## About the Project

The Grocery Store Management System is a Python-based project designed to simplify the process of purchasing grocery items online. Customers can easily browse through products, select items, view reviews, and place orders with ease. The system offers both customer and admin interfaces, making it convenient for both shoppers and administrators.

### Customer Experience

Customers can easily navigate the online store, select products, and view product reviews from other consumers. After adding items to the cart, customers provide their name, address, and choose between payment options. 

### Admin Control

The admin interface provides an easy-to-use control panel for managing products. Admins can add, edit, or delete products effortlessly. When adding a new product, admin can provide details such as title, category, ratings, image, price, and description.
